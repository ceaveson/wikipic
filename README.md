Get wiki names for pictures you're putting on a wiki


So we have a work Wiki and I don't know if it's just an old version but it is horrible
to put guides up which have lots of pictures. So I made this script to make my life easier.
Its really simple but makes my life easier.

So firstly I put all my pictures/screenshots in their own folder and give them nice descriptive names.
I then put my script in the same folder and run it and it gives me the Wiki image links that will be created.
I upload the images and then can just paste my output of the script to the Wiki page i'm going to use
them on and arrange.

What my descriptive filenames look like:

VFW SETUP - CLI after commands.png

VFW SETUP - CLI boot.png

VFW SETUP - Change to interface mode.png

VFW SETUP - DHCP server to remove.png

VFW SETUP - FW system info.png


Run script:

python wikipic.py

Output:

[[File:VFW_SETUP_-_Change_to_interface_mode.png]]

[[File:VFW_SETUP_-_CLI_after_commands.png]]

[[File:VFW_SETUP_-_CLI_boot.png]]

[[File:VFW_SETUP_-_DHCP_server_to_remove.png]]
